# Velocity - Smart Rental Software

Velocity is an innovative solution aimed at addressing the pressing challenges in the rental market, particularly focusing on security, transparency, and ease of coordination for both landlords and tenants.

## Problem Statement

The current rental market is riddled with issues such as scams, manipulated photos, lack of transparency, and credibility concerns. Additionally, the process of coordinating viewing dates and ensuring accessibility for both parties can be cumbersome.

## Solution

### 1. Video Aspect:
   - Integration of live streaming options to facilitate real-time property viewing, reducing the risk of scams.
   - Implementation of 3D models of properties(based on previous recordings) or access to recordings from previous viewing sessions to provide a comprehensive understanding of the rental space.

### 2. Established Profiles:
   - Incorporation of background checks for both landlords and tenants to mitigate fraudulent activities.
   - Integration of a rating and review system to enhance credibility and transparency within the platform.

### 3. Document Upload:
   - Utilization of public databases such as Land Registry search to cross-reference landlords' documents, ensuring authenticity.
   - Verification of realtor credentials through realtor ID authentication for added security.
